# Incident Response Plan

## Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to provide guidelines for handling security incidents that affect the organization's information systems and data. The policy defines the roles and responsibilities of the incident response team and establishes procedures for reporting, detecting, analyzing, containing, eradicating, and recovering from security incidents.

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who have access to the organization's information systems and data.

## Definitions

- **Security Incident**: An event that violates the organization's security policies or procedures and threatens the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the information systems and data.
- **Incident Response Team (IRT)**: A group of individuals who are responsible for managing security incidents and ensuring that they are resolved in a timely and effective manner.
- **Incident Response Plan (IRP)**: A documented plan that outlines the procedures for responding to security incidents.

## Roles & Responsibilities

- **Incident Response Team (IRT)**: Responsible for managing security incidents and ensuring that they are resolved in a timely and effective manner.
- **Information Security Officer (ISO)**: Responsible for overseeing the IRT and ensuring that the organization's security policies and procedures are followed.
- **All employees, contractors, and third-party vendors**: Responsible for reporting security incidents to the IRT as soon as they are detected.

## Prioritization

- **P1 - Critical**: Incidents that severely impact the organization's operations or pose a significant threat to sensitive data.
- **P2 - High**: Incidents that impact a major system or a significant portion of the organization but do not halt operations completely.
- **P3 - Medium**: Incidents that affect non-critical systems or a small portion of the organization.
- **P4 - Low**: Incidents that have minimal impact on the organization's operations.

## Preparation

- Develop and maintain an Incident Response Plan (IRP) that outlines the procedures for detecting, reporting, analyzing, containing, eradicating, and recovering from security incidents.
- Identify and train members of the Incident Response Team (IRT) who are responsible for managing security incidents.
- Establish procedures for notifying the IRT, senior management, and other stakeholders in the event of a security incident.

## Detection & Analysis

- **Detection**:
  - Implement and maintain monitoring tools to detect potential security incidents.
  - Establish a process for analyzing alerts and determining whether they constitute a security incident.
- **Analysis**:
  - Perform a thorough analysis of the incident to understand its scope, impact, and root cause.
  - Document all findings and actions taken during the analysis phase.

## Containment, Eradication & Recovery

- **Containment**:
  - Implement measures to contain the incident and prevent further damage to the organisation's information systems and data, including:
    * Isolating affected systems from the network.
    * Shutting down affected systems, if necessary.
    * Blocking network traffic associated with the incident.
  - Decide whether to use short-term or long-term containment strategies based on the nature and severity of the incident.
- **Eradication**:
  - Identify and remove the root cause of the incident.
  - Implement measures to ensure that the threat does not recur.
- **Recovery**:
  - Restore affected systems and services to normal operation.
  - Verify that the systems are functioning correctly and that no threats remain.

## Post-incident Activity

- Conduct a post-incident review to assess the effectiveness of the response.
- Document lessons learned and update the IRP accordingly.
- Provide training or awareness programs if needed to prevent similar incidents in the future.
- Generate a final report summarizing the incident, response actions, and recommendations for improvement.
