# Incident Response Plan (IRP)

## Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to provide guidelines for handling security incidents that affect the [Organisation]'s information systems and data. The policy defines the roles and responsibilities of the incident response team and establishes procedures for reporting, detecting, analyzing, containing, eradicating, and recovering from security incidents.

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who have access to the organization's information systems and data.

## Definitions

- **Security Incident**: An event that violates the organization's security policies or procedures and threatens the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the information systems and data.
- **Incident Response Team (IRT)**: A group of individuals who are responsible for managing security incidents and ensuring that they are resolved in a timely and effective manner.
- **Incident Response Plan (IRP)**: A documented plan that outlines the procedures for responding to security incidents.

## Roles & Responsibilities

- **Incident Response Manager (IRC)**: Responsible for overseeing the IRT, providing oversight and communication to stakeholders.
- **Information Security Officer (ISO)**: Responsible for overseeing the IRP and ensuring that the organization's security policies and procedures are followed.
- **All employees, contractors, and third-party vendors**: Responsible for reporting security incidents to the IRT as soon as they are detected.

## Prioritization

- **P1 - Critical**: Incidents that severely impact the organization's operations or pose a significant threat to sensitive data.
- **P2 - High**: Incidents that impact a major system or a significant portion of the organization but do not halt operations completely.
- **P3 - Medium**: Incidents that affect non-critical systems or a small portion of the organization.
- **P4 - Low**: Incidents that have minimal impact on the organization's operations.

## Preparation

- Develop and maintain an Incident Response Plan (IRP) that outlines the procedures for detecting, reporting, analyzing, containing, eradicating, and recovering from security incidents.
- Identify and train members of the Incident Response Team (IRT) who are responsible for managing security incidents.
- Establish procedures for notifying the IRT, senior management, and other stakeholders in the event of a security incident.

## Detection & Analysis

- **Detection**:
  - Implement and maintain monitoring tools to detect potential security incidents.
  - Establish a process for analyzing alerts and determining whether they constitute a security incident.
- **Analysis**:
  - Perform a thorough analysis of the incident to understand its scope, impact, and root cause.
  - Document all findings and actions taken during the analysis phase.

## Containment, Eradication & Recovery

- **Containment**:
  - Implement measures to contain the incident and prevent further damage to the organisation's information systems and data, including:
    * Isolating affected systems from the network.
    * Shutting down affected systems, if necessary.
    * Blocking network traffic associated with the incident.
  - Decide whether to use short-term or long-term containment strategies based on the nature and severity of the incident.
- **Eradication**:
  - Identify and mitigate all vulnerabilities that were exploited.
  - Remove malware, inappropriate materials, and other components
  - If more affected hosts are discovered (e.g., new malware infections), repeat the Detection and Analysis steps to identify all other affected hosts, then contain and eradicate the incident for them
- **Recovery**:
  - Restore affected systems to an operationally ready state.
  - Confirm that the affected systems are functioning normally no threats remain.
  - If necessary, implement additional monitoring to look for future related activity.

## Post-incident Activity

- Conduct a post-incident review to assess the effectiveness of the response.
- Document lessons learned and update the IRP accordingly.
- Provide training or awareness programs if needed to prevent similar incidents in the future.
- Generate a final report summarizing the incident, response actions, and recommendations for improvement.

## Metrics and Continuous Improvement

- Incident Metrics
  * Track key metrics such as incident detection time, response time, and recovery time.
  * Analyse metrics to assess the effectiveness of the incident response program and identify trends.
    
-Continuous Improvement
  * Regularly review and update the incident response policy and procedures to reflect changes in the threat landscape and organisational environment.
  * Conduct periodic incident response drills and exercises to validate the effectiveness of the IRP and team readiness.
  * Incorporate feedback from drills, exercises, and post-incident reviews to continually improve the incident response process.
    
## Compliance and Enforcement
- Compliance
  * Ensure compliance with relevant laws, regulations, and industry standards related to incident management.
  * Conduct regular audits to verify adherence to this policy and identify areas for improvement.

- Enforcement
  * Non-compliance with this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.
  * Contractors, vendors, and agents who violate this policy may face penalties as per their contract terms.
- Approval
  * This policy is approved by the [Executive Leadership/Board of Directors] and is effective as of [Date].
